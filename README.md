# Observations and Insights

#### 1.  As shown in the summary statistics table comparing all of the drug regimens by tumor volume over the 45 day test period, both Capomulin & Ramicane stand out as having a lower Mean Tumor Volume and Tumor Standard Deviation. 

#### 2.  The Pearson correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84.  This suggests a strong positive correlation as a mouse's weight increases the mouse's average tumor volume will also increase.   
#### 3.  Of the selected drug regimens of interest (Capomulin, Ramicane,  Infuinol, Ceftamin),  both Capomulin & Ramicane are showing promising results with smaller final tumor volumes. 
#### 4.  During the study, the distribution of female versus male mice was fairly even at 51% male and 49% female.
